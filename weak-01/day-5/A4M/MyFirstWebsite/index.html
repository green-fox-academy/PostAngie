        <h2> <span class=title>I am who I am</span></h2>
        <p>I have philosophical thoughts about the human existance. First of all, I am You, and You are Me. Together We are, that includes Them as well. It represents the fundamental identity between the microcosm and the macrocosm. It means, that the world I witness is a mirror to my own consciousness, and the understanding of oneness begins with my understanding that I am the other, which I appear to be observing.
